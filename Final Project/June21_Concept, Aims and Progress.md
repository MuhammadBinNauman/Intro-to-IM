## Guitar Hero

The final project will be a rythem based game. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lf8Uw2BTJiw

In the processing part of the game. there will be 4 rows were nodes will come down on. each row would corrospond to a button on the breadboard. when the nodes reach a certain marked point on the screen the player needs to press a appropriate button according the node the exact moment the node reaches the marked point. the distence between the marked point and node will determine the score of the player the closer the button press will be according to the position of the node the more points you will get. at the end the total score will be shown.

On the breadboard there will be 4 distictly colored button that would relate to each row in the game. there may also be a potentiometer that would speed up the game or slow it down as it would be connected to the frame count. A speaker will also be connected to the breadboard that will allow it play distinct sounds related to each button.

## Important things 

needs to communicate with the digital buttons between processing and arduino ide

there should be 4 different rows that will send circle across the screen that will have colors corrosponding to the button colors

there should be a marker on each row that will tell when the player should press the button when the circle touches the marker 

a formula that will calculate the score of the player depending on the accuracy of the button press

score and final score to be displayed

music should be playing in the background 

the buttons could be random as making presses according to the song may be to hard and time consuming 

## Extra things

music related visuals 

a way to control the speed of the game 

attach a LCD display to the breadboard that will also display the score 

more visuals
