In the processing part of the game. there will be 4 rows were nodes will come down on. each row would corrospond to a button on the breadboard. when the nodes reach a certain marked point on the screen the player needs to press a appropriate button according the node the exact moment the node reaches the marked point. the distence between the marked point and node will determine the score of the player the closer the button press will be according to the position of the node the more points you will get. at the end the total score will be shown.

On the breadboard there will be 4 distictly colored button that would relate to each row in the game. there may also be a potentiometer that would speed up the game or slow it down as it would be connected to the frame count. A speaker will also be connected to the breadboard that will allow it play distinct sounds related to each button.
