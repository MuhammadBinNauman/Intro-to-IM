Created a array that would spawn enemies in as red squares at random locations 


#### Difficulty

The redboard connector has really bad contact points had to bend the wires inorder to connect them

Forgot to use a resistor with one of the LED's caused it to explode

#### Helpful Source

Sparkfun has a youtube channel that does tutorials
